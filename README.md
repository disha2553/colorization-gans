# Landscape Image Colorization using GANs

## Project Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to automatically colorize grayscale landscape images. The model learns to generate visually pleasing color versions of black-and-white images using paired grayscale and color training data.

---

## Dataset

- The model is trained on a dataset of **landscape images** consisting of paired **grayscale** and **color** images.
- Images are resized to **128Ã—128 pixels** for efficient training.
- Dataset source: [Insert Dataset Source or link if public]

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

- **Generator:** A convolutional encoder-decoder network with skip connections (similar to U-Net) that takes a grayscale image as input and outputs a 3-channel RGB color image.
- **Discriminator:** A convolutional PatchGAN classifier that distinguishes between real color images and those generated by the generator.
- **Loss Functions:**  
  - GAN loss encouraging the generator to produce realistic images.  
  - L1 loss (mean absolute error) to enforce pixel-level similarity between generated and real images.

### Training Setup

- Framework: TensorFlow 2.x and Keras API  
- Optimizers: Adam with learning rate 2e-4 and beta1=0.5 for both generator and discriminator  
- Batch Size: 32  
- Number of Epochs: 20 (modifiable)  
- Image preprocessing includes normalization to [0,1].
