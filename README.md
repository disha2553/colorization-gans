# Landscape Image Colorization using GANs

## Project Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to automatically colorize grayscale landscape images. The model learns to generate visually pleasing color versions of black-and-white images using paired grayscale and color training data.

---

## Dataset

- The model is trained on a dataset of **landscape images** consisting of paired **grayscale** and **color** images.
- Images are resized to **128×128 pixels** for efficient training.
- Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theblackmamba31/landscape-image-colorization

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

- **Generator:** A convolutional encoder-decoder network with skip connections (similar to U-Net) that takes a grayscale image as input and outputs a 3-channel RGB color image.
- **Discriminator:** A convolutional PatchGAN classifier that distinguishes between real color images and those generated by the generator.
- **Loss Functions:**  
  - GAN loss encouraging the generator to produce realistic images.  
  - L1 loss (mean absolute error) to enforce pixel-level similarity between generated and real images.

### Training Setup

- Framework: TensorFlow 2.x and Keras API  
- Optimizers: Adam with learning rate 2e-4 and beta1=0.5 for both generator and discriminator  
- Batch Size: 32  
- Number of Epochs: 20 (modifiable)  
- Image preprocessing includes normalization to [0,1].


## How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites
- You need a Kaggle account to download the dataset using the Kaggle API.
- Download your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) from your Kaggle account:
  1. Go to [Kaggle Account](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
  2. Scroll down to "API" section and click **Create New API Token**
  3. This will download `kaggle.json` file to your computer.

### Steps to Run on Google Colab (Recommended)

1. **Upload `kaggle.json` file** to your Colab environment.
2. **Set up Kaggle API and download the dataset**
3. **Run your training and evaluation scripts** as per the notebook or script provided.

### GPU Support on Colab

- Google Colab provides **free access to GPU runtime** (Tesla T4/P100/K80) which significantly speeds up training deep learning models.
- To enable GPU:
  - Go to **Runtime > Change runtime type** in Colab
  - Select **GPU** as hardware accelerator
- Note:  
  - GPU sessions are limited to approximately 12 hours and may disconnect after periods of inactivity.
  - You can restart the runtime and run your notebook again; however, you may need to re-download datasets and reload/save your model.

### Runtime Notes

- Colab’s runtime environment is ephemeral — files and models stored in `/content` will be deleted after disconnect or idle timeout.
- To **preserve your trained models and data**, consider mounting your **Google Drive** and saving/loading from there.
- Each time you restart, your environment (dataset, models) needs to be set up again (downloaded or loaded from Drive).
